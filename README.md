### This is not production ready

I will release this to Elm packages once it's ready

Edit 2015-05-28:

I'm working on a major refactor that will bring this library into closer parity with official Phoenix JavaScript library that comes bundled with the framework. I'm almost done. I will release the 1.0.0 version of this library within the next week.
